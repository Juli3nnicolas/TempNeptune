- Compile the whole engine
- Run a mandelbrot fractal example
- Improve the architecure config with cmake (compiling in 32 bits or 64 bits is messy at the moment)
- Add the FINAL configuration
- Build the whole engine as a static library, not an exe
- Create a new cmake file to fine tune compilation options
